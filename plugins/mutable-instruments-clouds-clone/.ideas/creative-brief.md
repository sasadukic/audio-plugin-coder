# Creative Brief - Mutable Instruments Clouds Clone

## Hook
A faithful clone-inspired granular texture processor that recreates the signature Clouds behavior: diffuse, smeared micro-loops with playable pitch-shifted ambience.

## Description
This plugin aims to reproduce the core sonic identity of Mutable Instruments Clouds as closely as practical in a desktop plugin format. The processor should take incoming audio and transform it into dense granular clouds with the same musical instability and atmospheric bloom associated with the original module.

The focus is authenticity over novelty:
- Granular response should feel immediate and alive, especially with short transient material.
- Time-smearing and overlap should preserve the recognizable Clouds-style haze.
- Pitch behavior should support both subtle detune texture and obvious shifted artifacts.
- Density behavior should move smoothly from sparse grains to continuous cloud mass.

## Target Use Cases
- Turning dry synths into drifting ambient beds
- Expanding percussive transients into textured tails
- Creating frozen/micro-loop style movement for sound design

## Visual Direction
Dark, minimal, hardware-inspired interface with high contrast controls and clear parameter readouts.
