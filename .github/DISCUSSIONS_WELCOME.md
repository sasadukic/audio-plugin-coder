# Welcome to Audio Plugin Coder (APC) Discussions! 🎵

Welcome to the APC community! This is a space for audio developers, AI enthusiasts, musicians, and creative coders to connect, share knowledge, and help each other build amazing audio plugins.

## About APC

**Audio Plugin Coder (APC)** is an AI-powered framework for building professional audio plugins from concept to shipped product. Using a structured five-phase workflow (Ideate → Plan → Design → Implement → Ship), APC guides you through the entire plugin development lifecycle with the help of AI agents.

### Key Features
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Development** - Works with Claude Code, Antigravity, Kilo, and other agents
- 🎯 **Structured Workflows** - Five-phase system ensures quality at every step
- 🎨 **Dual UI Frameworks** - Choose between Visage (pure C++) or WebView (HTML5 Canvas)
- 📊 **State Management** - Automatic progress tracking and validation
- 🔧 **Self-Improving** - Auto-captures troubleshooting knowledge
- 🏗️ **Production Ready** - JUCE 8 integration with CMake build system
